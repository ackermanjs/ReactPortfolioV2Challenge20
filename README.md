## React Portfolio Challenge 20

# Introduction
This is a simple portfolio built with React. For this assignment, due to a time crunch, I chose to build a very simple portfolio with minimum styling.

# Deployed Application
The deployed application can be viewed here:

# Functionality
The user will arrive at a very basic portfolio page. They can select links from the top navigation bar. These links will load the content without refreshing the page.

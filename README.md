## React Portfolio Challenge 20

# Introduction
This challenge was rebuilding my Student Portfolio with React. I went in a fun, playful direction with this portfolio and tried out some interesting design elements. All the graphical layouts were creating by Me.

# Deployed Application
I had trouble getting my React Portfolio to deploy on GitHub Pages, so I deployed it to Heroku instead. Here's the link: https://mighty-ocean-43157.herokuapp.com/

# Functionality
Access the deployed application via the Heroku link: https://mighty-ocean-43157.herokuapp.com/. You can navigate throught he page using the links on the top nav bar.
